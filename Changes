Revision history for Perl extension Log::Info.

2.00  Sun Dec 19  8:56AM GMT 2010
 	- Log::Info is now a wrapper around Log::Log4perl.  This is intended
	  as a migration path.  New users should just use Log::Log4perl
	  instead.  Existing users should start migrating.  t/log4perl.t has
	  examples of mixed use.

1.22  Wed Feb 24  5:50PM GMT 2010
	- Log::Info::Fork no longer works well with arbitrary file descriptors.
	  rather than fixing, I've demoted the test as prelude to integrating
	  with IPC::System or IPC::Run.
        - tweak single-die.t to work with modern Carp installs
	- migrate syslog.t to xt/ (because it writes to syslog, which upsets
	  people running syslog reapers)

1.21  Sat Feb  5  5:24PM GMT 2005
	- Return log level from enable_file_channel (relative to LOG_INFO-1)

1.20  Sat Feb  5  2:30PM GMT 2005
	- correct enable_file_channel to consider a single numeric arg as a log level
	  rather than a file

1.19  Fri May 30  6:52PM GMT 2003
	- Correct bug in _log_to_file causing filehandles to get consumed at
	  a rate of one per log message!

1.18  Wed Mar 19  4:34PM GMT 2003
	- Don't check exitcode of 'date' in TRANS_CDT

1.17  Wed Jan 22  5:26PM GMT 2003
	- Fixes for perl 5.8.0
	- Don't perform t/single-die.t, t/trap.t without IPC-Run, since the
	  non-IPC-Run loop has some timing issues

          seconds (if called often enough), update after every message
	- Buglet in Logf when confused by incoming fixed ($_ in q!! literal 
	  replaced)
